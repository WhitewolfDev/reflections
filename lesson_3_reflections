When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working from multiple devices or when work is shared between more than one person.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because one or more commits might go into a single "change".  Pulling down too soon might cause problems in code on the local machine.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a clone on GitHub. It provides a link to the original repository. Informs developer when someome clones their work.
A clone is a copy of a repositoy either on the drive or from GitHub.
A branch is a split inside of a repository to keep code intact while working on something different.  Each branch can have a separate and shared path of commits.  Branches can be merged again at some point in the future.
